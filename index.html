      Shawty don't even know, she can get in it for the low
      Told me she not a pro, it's okay, it's under control
      Show me soprano 'cause, girl, you can handle
      Baby, we start slow, then you come up and park close
      Girl, I'm the whistle man, my Bugatti the same notes
      Show me your perfect pitch, you got it, my banjo
      Talented with your lips like you blew out a candle
      So amusing (Amusing)
      Now you can make a whistle with the music (Music)
      Hope you ain't got no issues, you can do it (Do it)
      Even if it's no picture, never lose it (Lose it)

      Let me see you whistle while you work it
      I'ma lay it back, don't stop it
      'Cause I love it how you drop it, drop it, drop it on me
